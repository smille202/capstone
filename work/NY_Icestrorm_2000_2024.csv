Precipitation began as rain for most areas on February 3 with the exception of the Adirondacks which began as a mix of rain and snow. Colder air gradually pushed southward into the overnight and early morning hours of February 4 resulting in a changeover to a wintry mix of sleet, freezing rain and snow. Most locations picked up 1 to 2 inches of liquid equivalent precipitation from this event with the majority of it falling as one or multiple types of frozen precipitation. Precipitation ended during the afternoon hours on February 4.||Portions of the western Mohawk Valley and Adirondacks into portions of far northern Washington County saw mostly heavy snow from this event with accumulations ranging from 9 to 18 inches. The remainder of the Mohawk Valley into the Lake George Saratoga Region had mostly a combination of snow and sleet. Storm total snow and sleet amounts in this zone were in the 4 to 9 inch range. The Schoharie Valley into the Capital District and northern Taconics had an initial period of freezing rain before transitioning to a prolonged period of sleet, then ended as a period of light snow. Flat ice accumulations of 0.10 to 0.25 of an inch were observed followed by 1 to 2 inches of sleet and then 1 to 2 inches of snow. Much of the eastern Catskills, mid-Hudson Valley and central and southern Taconics remained rain for a longer period of time but gradually changed over to a prolonged period of freezing rain before ending as light snow and sleet. Flat ice amounts between 0.25 to 0.75 of an inch were common across the region with snow and sleet amounts of 2 inches or less.||Eastern Ulster County was the hardest hit with widespread damage due to ice accretion including downed trees and power lines and widespread power outages, some of which lasted for days after the event. A handful of other customers in parts of Columbia and Rensselaer counties also lost power.||Utility companies noted that more than 50,000 customers lost power from the storm across the Hudson Valley, most of them in eastern Ulster County. At least 44 utility poles broke and more than 900 power lines came down as a result of the snow and ice with more than 500 individual damage locations. Several hundred electric line and tree cleaning professionals were called in to help clear roads from debris and restore power, some coming in from Indiana and Pennsylvania. Ulster County executive Pat Ryan declared a weather-related state of emergency for the area. The widespread power outages prompted the opening of warming centers and the distribution of dry ice. Members of the National Guard came in to assist in recovery operations. Cleanup efforts in Kingston cost the city approximately $100,000 according to lawmakers.||State Police reported multiple fallen trees along the New York State Thruway (Interstate 87 southbound) between exits 19 and 20, blocking the right lane of the highway, in Ulster County.||States of Emergencies went into effect for other jurisdictions as well including some in southern Herkimer County. ||The winter storm led to a 45 mph speed limit restriction to go into effect for the New York State Thruway.
