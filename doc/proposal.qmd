# Introduction

Insurance is a price that we all need to pay. Many people have noticed that property insurance prices, both for personal home and commercial businesses have continuously increased in the past years. This has become a topic of conversation for many and what people usually chalk it up to is inflation. However, there are multiple different factors that are likely contributing to the rise in insurance premiums. One significant possibility for the influx in prices is the increase in natural disasters and the damages they are causing. Insurance companies in areas most affected by natural disasters are then forced to raise prices in order to combat for losses and claims that occur in response to the events. So are property insurance prices increasing due to inflation or actually because of the higher risk of natural disasters?

# Dataset

Inflation Rate Dataset

World Bank, Inflation, consumer prices for the United States [FPCPITOTLZGUSA], retrieved from FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis; https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FPCPITOTLZGUSA, February 6, 2025.

Inflation as measured by the consumer price index reflects the annual percentage change in the cost to the average consumer of acquiring a basket of goods and services that may be fixed or changed at specified intervals, such as yearly.

# Data Acquisition and Processing

- Recode variables in multiple datasets that have the same variable names
- Impute missing values by deleting the row, as there is plenty of data that the value will not likely affect results
- Overall, the data is pretty tidy but will be thoroughly examined


# Research Questions and Methodology

Question:
Are property insurance rates rising due to inflation or higher risks of natural disasters?

Using exploratory data analysis visualizations, I plan to answer if insurance rates are rising at the levels of inflation or levels of increased natural disasters. I will use linegraphs to compare the rates of increase of both natural disasters and insurance rates over time, a correlation heatmap between inflation rates and insurance premiums, and histograms to track the cost of damages done by hurricanes in Florida and ice storms in New York to see if costly disasters are on the rise over time. 

Once the data is visualized and trends are able to be depicted in insurance rates, inflation and natural disaster occurrences, I will use the data in a hypothesis test. This will allow me to statistically test whether the rise in insurance rates have a significant correlated with inflation or natural disasters. My null hypothesis is that insurance rates are increasing at the same rate as inflation. The alternative hypothesis is that insurance rates are increasing at a significantly higher rate, suggesting other contributing factors such as natural disasters.

Finally, I will use multiple linear regression to quantify the relationships. It will determine how much the insurance rates are influenced by inflation and natural disasters to find which or if both factors have a strong correlation with the increase in insurance premiums.
